## Purpose
- Provides infrastructure utilities shared across backend modules: accelerator detection, configuration parsing, registry tooling.

## Subdirectories
- `accelerators/` — Accelerator discovery and device capability helpers.
- `config/` — Dynamic configuration loaders and CLI argument wiring.
- `registry/` — Shared registry utilities used by engines, services, and runtime modules.

## Notes
- Keep infrastructure logic here to avoid scattering environment/CLI handling across business logic modules.
- When adding new accelerator backends or configuration sources, update these helpers instead of embedding logic in engines.
