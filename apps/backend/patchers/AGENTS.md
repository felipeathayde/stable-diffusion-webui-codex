## Purpose
- Hosts runtime patching utilities (LoRA injection, token merging, adapter application) that modify networks or inference behavior after models are loaded.

## Key Files
- `base.py` — Core `ModelPatcher` with typed registries (LoRA/object patches) and lifecycle hooks.
- `lora.py` — Implements `CodexLoraLoader` and variant-aware merge helpers backed by typed payloads, progress reporting, and strict validation.
- `lora_apply.py` — Applies native LoRA selections to loaded networks.
- `token_merging.py` — Implements token merging strategies consumed by engines/use cases.
- `unet.py` — Codex-native UNet patcher built on typed helpers (`SamplingReservation`, `ControlNetChain`) for deterministic sampling reservations, ControlNet chaining, and patch registration.
- `clipvision.py` — Adapter around `apps/backend/runtime/vision/clip/` providing legacy-facing APIs backed by the Codex encoder.
- Additional patch modules (e.g., adapters) live here as they are ported.

## Notes
- Patchers should operate on runtime objects provided by `runtime/` and `engines/` without duplicating loading logic.
- LoRA merges are transactional: loaders snapshot parameters, track deterministic patch order, surface tqdm progress, and raise on any mismatched tensor metadata.
- When introducing new patch behaviour, add explicit configuration flags/options and document them in `.sangoi/backend/`.
- Mutator methods must raise on invalid payloads (no fallbacks) and emit backend debug logs; `ModelPatcher` now centralises logging/telemetry for patch registration.
- ControlNet patching lives under `apps/backend/patchers/controlnet/`, with architecture-specific modules located in `architectures/` (SD today; Flux/Chroma placeholders ready). Use `apply_controlnet_advanced` or `UnetPatcher.add_control_node` to register controls.
- Clip vision patcher reuses the runtime encoder; avoid reintroducing preprocessing or state-dict manipulation in the patcher—extend the runtime if new variants arise.
- Extension-facing compatibility is preserved via the new graph-backed patcher—no linked lists remain, and `UnetPatcher.add_patched_controlnet` builds `ControlNode` instances directly.
- VAE patcher now respects the AUTO precision ladder: decode/encode paths inspect for NaNs and escalate fp16↔bf16↔fp32 via `memory_management.report_precision_failure`; user-forced dtypes skip the ladder and surface explicit errors.

### unet.py notes
- `control_nodes` é uma propriedade somente leitura (retorna cópia). Acesse como `unet.control_nodes`, não `unet.control_nodes()`.
- `activate_control()` recompõe o composite (`build_composite`) sempre que os nós mudam (ex.: após `add_control_node`).
- 2025-11-02: removido `@property` duplicado em `control_nodes` que podia levar a `TypeError: 'property' object is not callable` em tempo de acesso.
