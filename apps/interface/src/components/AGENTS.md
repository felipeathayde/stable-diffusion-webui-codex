## Purpose
- Reusable Vue components (panels, form widgets, prompts, galleries) shared across views.

## Notes
- Components should be presentational and rely on Pinia stores or props for state.
- Follow the styling rules documented in `.sangoi/frontend/guidelines/frontend-style-guide.md`.
- Prompt parsing/serialization lives in `prompt/PromptToken.ts` with Vitest coverage; ensure new prompt widgets pass through that module.
- Generation + highres + refiner controls live in `GenerationSettingsCard.vue`, `HighresSettingsCard.vue`, and `RefinerSettingsCard.vue`, all using CSS grid layouts.
